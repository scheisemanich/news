    "description": "Trump könnte mit seiner Zollpolitik Handelskriege mit negativen wirtschaftlichen Folgen für alle Beteiligten verursachen. Offenbar hat die Wall Street das Risiko bisher unterschätzt.\n\n\nDie USA erheben seit Dienstag Strafzölle auf Waren aus Kanada und Mexiko in Höhe von 25 Prozent. Zudem werden die im Februar angeordneten Importzölle auf Waren aus China auf 20 Prozent verdoppelt. China reagierte umgehend mit Vergeltungszöllen auf Hühnerfleisch, Mais und andere landwirtschaftliche Erzeugnissen aus den USA in Höhe von 15 Prozent. Auch Kanada hat bereits Gegenmaßnahmen in Kraft gesetzt und Zölle in Höhe von 25 Prozent auf US-Waren eingeführt.\n\n„Die enge wirtschaftliche Verflechtung ist jetzt keine Garantie mehr für den Handelsfrieden. Das ist das Bittere dabei“, sagt Jürgen Matthes, Leiter des Clusters internationale Wirtschaftspolitik, Finanz- und Immobilienmärkte beim Institut der deutschen Wirtschaft in Köln. Über die negativen Folgen für alle Beteiligten spricht er im Podcast.\n\nZum Artikel: China und Kanada wehren sich gegen US-Zölle\nhttps://www.handelsblatt.com/politik/international/trump-china-und-kanada-wehren-sich-gegen-us-zoelle/100111264.html\n\nAußerdem: Die Strafzölle von US-Präsident Donald Trump schicken auch die Wall Street auf Talfahrt. US-Börsenexperte Markus Koch ordnet die Lage ein.\n\nModeriert von Anis Mičijević\nProduziert von Lukas Teppler\n\n\n***\n0:00 Start\n2:04 Marktbericht\n7:31 Trumps neue Zölle gegen Kanada, Mexiko & China\n17:57 Markus Koch über die Folgen von Trumps Politik für die Wall Street\n\n\n***\nDas exklusive Abo-Angebot für alle Hörerinnen und Hörer von Handelsblatt Today: www.handelsblatt.com/mehrfinanzen\n\nHelfen Sie uns, unsere Podcasts weiter zu verbessern.
